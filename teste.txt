JUNTAR DUAS LISTAS ORDENADAS EM UMA

juntar [] ys = ys
juntar xs [] = xs
juntar xs ys = if head xs <= head ys
  then (++) [head xs] (juntar (tail xs) ys)
  else (++) [head ys] (juntar xs (tail ys))

main = print $ juntar [1..3] [1..3]

PALINDROMO

palindromo [] = 1
palindromo xs = if ((head xs == last xs) && (length xs > 1))
  then palindromo (init (tail xs)) 
  else 0

main = print $ palindromo ["natan"]
